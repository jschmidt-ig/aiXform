##### You said:

“All right, we're going to work together to prepare.”

00:03

###### ChatGPT said:

Understood. Let's just proceed. Let me know what exactly you need to prepare, and we'll tackle it step by step.

##### You said:

“Okay, I'm going to just kind of throw out some perspectives and concerns, and you can help me put together a structure for it and kind of go through the answers. Does that make sense?”

00:21

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. Just go ahead and throw your thoughts at me, and I'll help you organize them into a solid structure as we go.

##### You said:

“All right, so, you know, we got two kind of layers of concern. One is kind of like the AIX form business model where we're going to sell training services. And I think we've got a pretty good outline for that at a high level, breaking them down into kind of like courseware, instructor-led, and then like more direct coaching. And now for Ensembl, they want us to do a 10-week course for them to help bring up to speed their development teams on AI SDLC.”

00:38

###### ChatGPT said:

Got it. So we've got basically two layers: one is the overall business model of selling these AI SDLC training services, and you've already got a pretty decent high-level breakdown: you know, courseware, instructor-led sessions, and more direct coaching.

Now for the Ensemble side specifically, they want a 10-week course to get their dev team up to speed on AI SDLC. So we’ll structure it out with that in mind. Let’s shape each of those pieces into a concrete plan.

##### You said:

“Yeah, so our project sponsor is DevData, one word, one name, and we're going to do a 10-week outline, and so I'm kind of thinking concerns he's going to have as far as questions is kind of like, you know, how does this fit into an overarching, like, strategic vision for how Ensembl can use AI, and then, you know, what is going to be the delivery mechanism, and how much time is it going to take for the developers on this team, and then how do we roll that out to the larger organization, and what are the success criteria metrics going to be?”

00:40

###### ChatGPT said:

All right, got it. So we’ll frame it around those concerns that Devdata might have. Basically, we’ll want to show how this 10-week course ties into Ensemble’s bigger strategic vision for AI. We’ll outline the delivery mechanism, how much time it’ll actually take the dev team per week, and then how we scale it up to the whole organization. Plus, we’ll define some success criteria and metrics so he can see what good looks like. Let’s flesh that out in the plan.

##### You said:

“Yeah, and then what I'm kind of thinking, we'll need to develop the course outline, but I'm kind of thinking it goes something like this, where the first two weeks are going to be AI fundamentals, and I'll just walk them through the fundamentals of AI and agentic coding, and that will, at the same time, we'll be going through what I'll call AI enablement, which is basically we've got to work with Ensembl to get it set up. How are developers actually going to have access to the AI tooling, and what are the security and rules going to be around that? And my thoughts are basically we can do a lab environment that can be set up by us or by them in their own cloud environment, and so that would be an isolated self-contained area. I can do dev containers, which would be, you know, Docker containers that would run on their local machines, or we could do, like, if they're on Windows, WSL,”

01:07

###### ChatGPT said:

All right, perfect.

##### You said:

“And we'll have to work with Dave Dotta to figure out what approach he wants to do.”

00:06

###### ChatGPT said:

Exactly. So we’ll lay out those options in the plan: the first couple of weeks cover AI fundamentals and agentic coding, plus the AI enablement piece to get their tooling and security in place. We can offer those three environments—either a cloud-based lab we set up, local dev containers, or WSL if they’re on Windows. Then we just confirm with Devdata which route they prefer. Let’s get that all structured out.

##### You said:

“Now I'm thinking, and this is kind of up in the air, so like those first two weeks on AI Fundamentals, the idea would be we'd record that, and that could be courseware, and so that could roll out to the rest of the teams. Like I'm thinking for this initial team, he can pick, but it'll be somewhere between one to three teams, probably, you know, 15 max, 20 people, I think, though, keeping it at 15 would be good for this first round.”

00:29

###### ChatGPT said:

Yep, that makes sense. So we’ll note that those first two weeks of AI fundamentals will be recorded as courseware. That way it can scale out later to more teams easily. For this initial cohort, we’ll keep it to about 15 people, max 20, but aiming at around 15 for this first run. And then once it’s all recorded and set up, it can roll out more broadly. We’ll bake that into the structure.

##### You said:

“And in the next four weeks, we'll be instructor-led with lab exercises, and we'll be working them, walking them through example projects of how to use all the different features of agentic coding, and also we'll work out for the teams how they want to use AI in this new process in their existing system.”

00:26

###### ChatGPT said:

All right, so we'll slot in those next four weeks as instructor-led sessions with hands-on labs. We'll guide them through practical example projects so they can really get a feel for agentic coding features. And we’ll also help them figure out how to integrate AI into their existing workflows. So that covers that middle chunk.

##### You said:

“And then the last four weeks will basically be instructor-led and coached on IMPL tools and new agentic workflow on their assigned projects.”

00:16

###### ChatGPT said:

Perfect. So that last four-week block is all about instructor-led coaching as they apply these new tools and the agentic workflow directly to their own assigned projects. So we’ll have them actually implement what they’ve learned and get one-on-one or small group coaching to make sure they’re comfortable with everything in real scenarios. And that should wrap up the whole 10-week plan nicely.

##### You said:

“Yeah, and I think that's a pretty good model. Now let's go over kind of what I laid out was his concerns and what our answers are going to be to those.”

00:07

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely. So let’s quickly recap. For Devdata’s concerns: first, how it fits into the bigger strategic vision—that’s covered by making the fundamentals scalable and aligned with their AI goals. Second, the delivery mechanism and time commitment: we’ve defined a mix of recorded courseware, instructor-led labs, and coaching, and we’re keeping it around 10 weeks total with a modest weekly time load. And finally, rolling it out to the larger org and measuring success—since the fundamentals are recorded and repeatable, we can easily scale, and we’ll define clear success metrics like project completion and team proficiency.

So that should address his main questions with a solid, structured answer.

##### You said:

“Yeah, and now I'll give you kind of a little overview of some more detail for stuff I'd like to kind of put into a presentation or maybe an infogram for them. So, you know, the first one is where does this fit into the AI strategic vision? And I would kind of say it like this, like when we started with the Pulse platform, you know, the idea was to build a platform to support agents running, you know, like AR follow-up and stuff like that. But over time, what we kind of have realized is that to win in AI, like, you know, the agents are going to need like more than just platform support. They're going to need the organization to be able to develop tools and APIs. Basically, they're going to have to get better at software and API development. And so we assisted on that with the MR upload, the Mr. Upload project, but ran into significant difficulty, basically, with infrastructure and deployment. And we definitely see that the, yeah, so I'll come back to that. And so that's where we came up with Enclave or Enclave, actually we call it Enclave. And so that is kind of the main deliverable now of the Pulse platform, where Enclave provides managed environments, infrastructure, you know, optimized for more rapid AI-based deployment. So Enclave is kind of the infrastructure as infrastructure platform needed. And then what I would say is the next fundamental is, you know, agentic development, as far as having agents that actually execute business processes is still complicated and evolving field, but AI agents for software development, for coding, works and is a solved problem now. And that has the ability to dramatically improve the speed and quality of the software that the organization writes, which will be necessary to support AI workloads.”

02:11

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, that all ties in really well. So we’ll frame that first part of the presentation like this: we started with Pulse as the foundation to support AI agents, but we realized the organization needs to upskill in software and API development to really leverage those agents. That led us to Enclave as the key infrastructure piece—managed environments that speed up AI deployment. And then the next layer is this agentic development training. AI agents for coding are mature enough now to really boost the speed and quality of our software, which is exactly what we need to handle those AI workloads effectively.

So we’ll line it up that way in the infogram: show the evolution from Pulse to Enclave to agentic development as the strategic path.

##### You said:

“Yeah, so then the next is, how do you roll this out and how do you, you know, get the culture to kind of buy in? And so this is our approach, is basically to train, you know, this first, you know, set of teams and kind of take them through a straightforward approach for two weeks is the fundamentals, four weeks in a lab environment, and by then we'll have worked out with the ensemble, you know, security, infrastructure, architecture, whatever groups need to sign off on having a development environment set up that they support. And then those last four weeks of training, we'll be working with them on actual projects and being able to look at metrics and productivity improvement.”

00:49

###### ChatGPT said:

Exactly. So we’ll lay that out as the cultural rollout plan. We start with this initial team, give them a clear phased approach—two weeks of fundamentals, four weeks of labs, and by that point we’ve got all the infrastructure kinks worked out with Ensemble’s security and architecture teams. Then the last four weeks are about real projects and measuring productivity boosts, and that way the initial team becomes the model for the rest of the organization to buy in over time. So that’s how we’ll frame the rollout and the cultural adoption piece.

##### You said:

“Yeah, the next thing I want to kind of do is an infogram of how I kind of see the progression of using AI for SDLC as far as almost like a maturity level or skill set level, where I would say like level one was kind of the first GitHub copilot model, which is using it as basically a code assist and a smart autocomplete. So in there, the main visual model is the developer coding away and the AI basically helping, you know, just complete snippets of code here and there. So then the next level, which is what we are training on, is agentic coding agents. And what that model is basically that the AI agent is actually doing the majority of the coding, and you can kind of think of the software engineer as like right behind them looking over his shoulder telling him when he's doing things right or wrong, evaluating it. But the software engineer still checks in the code, evaluates the code, may handcraft some of the code, but the paradigm shifts where the agent is doing the majority of the coding.”

01:13

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, we can lay that out visually. So the infogram can show this progression of maturity levels. Level one is the early stage—think of it as using AI like GitHub Copilot just for autocomplete, where the developer is still doing most of the heavy lifting and the AI is just filling in code snippets here and there.

Then level two is what we’re training on now—agentic coding. In this model, the AI agent takes over the bulk of the coding work, and the software engineer becomes more of a reviewer or a guide. The developer’s role shifts to checking and refining the AI’s output rather than writing everything from scratch. So the infogram can illustrate that shift from human-driven coding with a bit of AI help to AI-driven coding with human oversight. That way, it’s really clear how the maturity model evolves.

##### You said:

“Yeah, and I would say then the next maturity level is basically having the AI coding agent do higher level skills, and what the software engineer does is actually creates the skills and the agent prompts and more of the system, and then they can set the agent up. Yeah, it's that door right up there. Yeah, and then they can have it do lead software engineering work, cloud infrastructure work, architecture work, thank you, product design, UI design, etc.”

00:41

###### ChatGPT said:

Absolutely. So that final maturity level is basically about turning the software engineer into someone who’s building the skills and prompts for the AI agent itself. So instead of just guiding the agent on coding tasks, the engineer is actually defining the agent’s higher-level capabilities. They’re creating the custom skills and handing off more complex work—like cloud infrastructure, architecture, or even product design—to the agent. So we’ll add that as the top tier of the infogram: the engineer sets up the system and the agent handles those higher-level engineering and design tasks. That really shows the full progression from simple autocomplete all the way up to AI doing high-level work with the engineer orchestrating.
