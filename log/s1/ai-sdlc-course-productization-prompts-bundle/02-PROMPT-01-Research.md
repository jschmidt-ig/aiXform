ChatGPT Folder > AI SDLC Product Strategy > 02-PROMPT-01-Research.md

You are a research analyst specializing in:
(1) enterprise technical training businesses,
(2) AI-assisted software delivery (AI SDLC),
(3) B2B pricing/packaging and enablement programs.

You MUST use web research and include citations for factual claims and examples.

GOAL
Create a “Research Packet” to inform product packaging, tier naming, delivery model, and pricing for an AI SDLC course product we are productizing from consulting delivery.

CONTEXT (treat as constraints)
- We have a 10-week paid consulting delivery (40h/week) with Ensemble (software engineers) and also want a similar course for Cigna (infra/data engineers).
- We want high overlap across cohorts; differences mostly in the on-ramp.
- We are shifting from hourly consulting to a scalable “seat-based training + optional coaching” product.
- Early delivery: synchronous (live demo + lab). Long-term: asynchronous/self-paced with office hours.
- Week 1 tooling may not be ready (Claude Code CLI install + internal model approvals). We need “week 1 off-network / low-permission” content while tool access is established.
- Coaching should ideally not require our coaches to have client laptops or internal network access.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS (include all)
A) Make the output product-grade:
- Produce: 1-page product brief, pricing/packaging table, sales narrative, FAQ, and a draft SOW add explained deliverables + inclusions/exclusions.
- Design a content capture pipeline (how we turn live sessions into reusable product assets).

B) Make it operational and repeatable:
- Provide: curriculum map (week→ lessons → objectives → artifacts → assessment).
- Provide: exercise bank split by greenfield vs brownfield + a “safe sandbox starter repo” plan.
- Provide: rubrics defining “good” for PRs, tests, docs, prompts.

C) Make it defensible in market:
- Competitive/market benchmarks WITH citations: comparable programs, pricing bands, delivery models, differentiation.
- Risk register (security, adoption, tool access, exec buy-in) + mitigations.

D) Force clarity:
- Explicit assumptions, open questions, and decision points.
- Two variants: MVP in 10 weeks vs scaled v2 in 6 months.

DELIVERABLE: RESEARCH PACKET (structure exactly)
1) Executive summary (max 10 bullets): key findings + implications for our offer
2) Market map (8–15 comparables)
   - Table: Company | Offer type | Delivery model | Pricing signals (if public) | Tiering/packaging patterns | Notes | Sources
3) Pricing benchmarks
   - Ranges and common units (per-seat, cohort, team pack, enterprise)
   - What costs more and why (coaching, private cohort, certification, custom labs, duration)
4) Packaging patterns (what works in the market)
   - Common tier structures (materials vs office hours vs embedded coaching)
   - Prerequisites/gating patterns (foundations before advanced coaching)
5) Naming patterns (replace “belt” terminology)
   - 12–20 naming options grouped by tone (enterprise, technical, playful)
   - Pros/cons and what the market tends to do
6) Measurement / KPI menu
   - Propose 8–12 measurable outcomes (lead time, deploy frequency, PR throughput, defect rate proxies, documentation completeness, test coverage, developer satisfaction, adoption)
   - Flag which are “controllable” vs “lagging/organizational”
7) Recommendations (based on evidence)
   - 2–3 packaging models that fit our constraints, with rationale
   - Suggested pricing structure(s), including team packs, and why
   - Suggested gross margin targets and typical ranges (cite if possible)
8) Risk register + mitigations (table)
9) Draft SOW addendum outline (what’s included/excluded per tier; assumptions; client responsibilities)
10) PASTE-FORWARD PACKET (FOR SYNTHESIS)
   - A concise 1–2 page block meant to be pasted into a second prompt.
   - MUST include: recommended packaging + naming + pricing ranges + the most useful tables + constraints summary.
   - Keep it tight; avoid long prose.

RULES
- If pricing is not public, say so; use credible signals and ranges with citations.
- Prefer primary sources (company pages, official pricing pages) and reputable outlets.
- Use citations throughout, close to where claims are made.
- If the constraints imply a trade-off, state it explicitly and give a recommendation.
