You are a product strategist + curriculum architect for AI SDLC enablement.
Do NOT browse the web. Use only the provided Research Packet and my constraints.
Be decisive: pick a path when trade-offs exist, and justify it briefly.

INPUTS
A) My original problem statement (below)
B) Research Packet (pasted below)
C) Captured inputs + constraints (below)

TASK
Synthesize the final product and course design and produce the full “product-grade” deliverable set.

OUTPUT (structure exactly)
1) Decisions (one screen)
   - Tier model (3 tiers) and gating prerequisites
   - Pricing model: units (seat/team/cohort), minimums, enterprise option, access duration, and support window
   - Naming scheme: tier names + replacement for “Training vs Coaching” (more professional)
   - Gross margin target + operational rationale

2) Product spec (tables)
   - Tier comparison table: Included/Excluded, seat model, coaching model, support channels, access duration, prerequisites
   - Operational load model: what requires live time vs what scales (include assumptions)
   - Client responsibilities table (what they must provide: repos, approvals, champions, time allocation)

3) 10-week curriculum architecture
   - Core curriculum map table:
     Week | Theme | Learning objectives | Live demo(s) | Hands-on lab | Artifact produced | Assessment
   - Two on-ramps (delta-only):
     A) Greenfield track
     B) Brownfield track (large codebase analysis, docs generation, testing, “safe PR” strategy)
   - Ensemble vs Cigna deltas (delta-only)
   - Week 1 “tooling not ready” plan: off-network, low-permission exercises + contingency path
   - Capstone plan (what they ship by week 10)

4) Exercise bank + starter repo plan
   - A bank of exercises grouped by:
     - Foundations (tooling, prompting, workflow)
     - Brownfield analysis/documentation/testing
     - Greenfield module build (e.g., observability module, test harness, CI improvements)
     - Safety/compliance drills (redaction, model choice, data handling)
   - A “safe sandbox starter repo” plan (language variants: .NET, Java, Python), including:
     - repo structure outline
     - sample tickets/user stories
     - evaluation rubric hooks

5) Content capture + productization pipeline
   - A repeatable system to convert live delivery into product assets:
     - what to record, templates, versioning, editing, and release cadence
   - Templates (provide as copy/paste sections):
     - lesson plan template
     - lab template
     - rubric template (PRs/tests/docs/prompts)
     - “brownfield codebase analysis” worksheet
     - prompt-pattern library template
   - A 10-week internal execution plan for us (what to build each week so we don’t fall behind)

6) GTM basics (tight, enterprise-focused)
   - ICP positioning (Ensemble SWE vs Cigna infra/data)
   - Buyer roles and buying triggers
   - Sales narrative + objection handling
   - FAQ (product + security + tooling constraints)

7) SOW addendum draft (concise)
   - Inclusions/exclusions per tier
   - Assumptions and dependencies
   - Success criteria / KPIs

8) Two variants
   - MVP (deliverable within 10 weeks)
   - v2 (scaled product within 6 months): asynchronous/self-paced, certification option, partner enablement

9) Assumptions + open questions + decision points
   - List assumptions you made
   - 10 highest-leverage questions to validate next
   - Decision points and “if/then” paths (e.g., if tool approvals slip, switch to X)

CONSTRAINTS
- Practical and delivery-aware: we cannot create a perfect course in 10 weeks.
- Optimize for sell-by-seat with optional coaching while preserving quality.
- Preserve high overlap across Ensemble and Cigna.
- Prefer coach “off network” operations; avoid requiring client laptops/internal access.
