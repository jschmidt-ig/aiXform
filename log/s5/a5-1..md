Understood. I have the full context loaded: the whiteboard, both Danny transcripts, and the existing product/spec artifacts.

### What I now have, concretely

- **Canonical 10-week structure** agreed verbally and visually:
  - **Weeks 1–2:** Fundamentals (lecture-only, no lab)
  - **Weeks 3–6:** Lab (safe sandbox, supervised)
  - **Weeks 7–10:** Applied (real Ensemble work, coaching + metrics)
- **Time-blocking intent** from the whiteboard:
  - Learner commitment target: **~5–8 hrs/week**
  - Instructor load broken into:
    - Lecture delivery
    - Lab setup + supervision
    - Content creation
    - Office hours / coaching
- **Clear mental model progression**:
  - Level 0: autocomplete (Copilot-only)
  - Level 1: agentic coding (human riding the agent)
  - Higher levels explicitly *out of scope* for this 10-week run
- **Delivery constraints baked in**:
  - Enterprise security is real
  - Off-network coaching preferred
  - Tooling approvals lag → Week-1 fallback required
- **Commercial intent already aligned**:
  - This engagement = seed content for a repeatable product
  - Live delivery first, capture → productize after

All of that aligns cleanly with the **AI-SDLC-Enablement-Spec** you already have Product-Sheets-AISDLC_PROMT-02-… and the **Student Schedule** artifact Product-Sheets-AISDLC_PROMT-02-….

### What I recommend we do next (in order, no fluff)

1. **Lock the 10-week “Ensemble v1” strawman**
   - Freeze:
     - Week themes
     - Learner weekly hour targets
     - Instructor hour budget per week
   - This becomes the *non-negotiable reference* for Scott/Dragon.
2. **Normalize the whiteboard into a single table**
   - One table with:
     - Week
     - Mode (Fundamentals / Lab / Applied)
     - Learner hours (lecture / lab / async)
     - Instructor hours (prep / delivery / office hours)
   - This answers “what are we actually committing to?” immediately.
3. **Extract 3 artifacts from this chat**
   - A **1-page internal delivery brief** (for Scott/Dragon travel use)
   - A **learner-facing time-commitment slide** (sets expectations)
   - A **sales-safe schematic** (2-4-4 progression + outcomes)
4. **Only then** move to:
   - Session titles
   - Lab themes
   - Metrics instrumentation details

If you want, I’ll do step **#2 immediately**: convert the whiteboard + transcripts into a **clean, authoritative 10-week time-blocking table** that becomes the source of truth for everything else.
