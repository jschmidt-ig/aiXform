### Ensemble AI-SDLC — 10-week time-commitment blocking (v1)

**Fixed structure:** **2 weeks Fundamentals (lecture)** → **4 weeks Lab (supervised)** → **4 weeks Applied (coaching)**. s5-Jan-13-10-11-AM-8b5d8c34-7b6e
 **Target learner load:** **~5–8 hrs/week** once labs start. s5-Jan-13-10-11-AM-8b5d8c34-7b6e
 **Cohorts:** planned as **two cohorts (C1, C2)**; Fundamentals can run **combined** (one larger Teams call) to reduce overhead. s5-Jan-13-10-11-AM-8b5d8c34-7b6e

## C) Instructor/coach load (so we don’t lie to ourselves)

This is the *operational* view (not learner-facing).

### Weeks 1–2 (Fundamentals)

- **Live lecture delivery:** about **1 hr/day** (≈ **4 hrs/week** if run 4 days)
- **Content creation:** **~5–7 hrs/day** while building courseware
- **Parallel work:** lab environment setup + security/IT coordination (goal: labs ready by end of Week 2)

### Weeks 3–10 (Lab + Applied)

- Expect **2–3 hrs/day** working with **two teams** (live + supervision), with the rest of the week in lab/exercise creation + support.
- Once content exists, the *steady-state* delivery target discussed was as low as **~8 hrs/week** (aspirational) for the delivery-only portion.

If you want, next step is to lock **one weekly calendar template** (exact day/time blocks) for C1/C2 so this becomes schedulable in Outlook/Teams without ambiguity.
