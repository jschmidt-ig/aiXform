# What to do (exact steps)

## Run 1 — Research (GPT-5.2 Pro Research / Deep Research, web ON)
1) Open ChatGPT.
2) Select **GPT-5.2 Pro Research** (or “Deep research”).
3) Turn **web/search ON** (globe icon).
4) Paste the entire contents of `02-PROMPT-01-Research.md`.
5) Replace the placeholders in the “PASTE BELOW” section with:
   - Your original problem statement (you can reuse the full `<problem>` block)
   - The captured answers in `01-Inputs-and-Constraints.md` (already formatted)
6) Run it.
7) When done, copy the section titled **“PASTE-FORWARD PACKET (FOR SYNTHESIS)”** from the output.
   - Keep it as clean text (no extra commentary).

## Run 2 — Synthesis (GPT-5.2 Thinking, web OFF)
1) Start a new chat (recommended) or continue in the same one.
2) Select **GPT-5.2 Thinking**.
3) Turn **web/search OFF** (globe icon off).
4) Paste the entire contents of `03-PROMPT-02-Thinking.md`.
5) In the “PASTE BELOW” section, paste:
   - Your original problem statement
   - The **PASTE-FORWARD PACKET** you copied from Run 1
6) Run it.
7) The output is your “product-grade” deliverable set: product spec, tiers, pricing, curriculum map, capture pipeline, templates, and MVP vs v2 plan.

## Optional: tighten outputs further
- If Run 1 output is large, paste only the “Paste-forward packet” + key tables into Run 2.
- If you want a version optimized for selling, re-run Run 2 with the same packet but add:
  “Also produce a 1-page sales deck outline and a 3-minute verbal pitch script.”

## Deliverables you should save
- Research output (full report) → save as PDF (ChatGPT export if available).
- Synthesis output → copy into a doc and split into:
  - Product brief
  - Pricing/packaging sheet
  - Curriculum + labs
  - Templates/rubrics
