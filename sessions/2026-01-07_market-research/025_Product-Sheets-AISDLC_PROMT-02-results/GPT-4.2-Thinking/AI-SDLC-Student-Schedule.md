# AI SDLC Enablement — Student Schedule (Practitioner Cohort, 10 Weeks)

## Assumptions
- Designed for the **Practitioner (Guided Cohort Enablement)** tier.
- Expected time: **~6 hours/week** (typical target range: 5–7 hours/week).
- Suggested cadence: **same time blocks each week** so it becomes routine.
- Replace “sandbox repo” with your team’s approved training repo if required by security.

## Weekly cadence (repeat every week)

| Day | Time (example) | Activity | Time |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| Monday | 6:00–7:00pm | Watch the week’s training module + take notes | 1h |
| Tuesday | 6:00–8:00pm | Lab block #1 (hands-on) | 2h |
| Wednesday | 12:00–1:00pm | Live cohort session (demo + Q&A) | 1h |
| Thursday | 6:00–8:00pm | Office hours (1h) + Lab block #2 (1h) | 2h |
| Friday | 4:00–5:00pm | Submit artifact(s) + quick self-review + plan next week | 1h |

**Total:** ~6 hours/week

Optional (if you fall behind):
- Sunday 30–60 min catch-up or “brownfield read-only analysis” time.

## Week-by-week schedule (mapped to the Core Curriculum)

| Week | Monday (1h) — Training module | Tuesday (2h) — Lab block #1 | Wednesday (1h) — Live demo/Q&A | Thursday (2h) — Office hours + Lab block #2 | Friday (1h) — Submit |

| 5 | Brownfield analysis mechanics (dependencies, risk, boundaries) | Run brownfield worksheet on target repo (read-only) | Brownfield mapping + risk ranking demo | Office hours + refine risk-ranked backlog + “safe PR” candidates | Brownfield worksheet + ranked backlog |
| 6 | Safe PR strategy (scaffolding, non-invasive improvements) | Build scaffolding PR: observability/test harness sidecar | Scaffold-only PR demo + review patterns | Office hours + finalize PR + rollout plan | Safe PR + rollout plan + test/obs notes |
| 7 | CI/CD quality gates (lint/test/coverage thresholds) | Add gates to pipeline template (repo-safe) | Quality gates demo + Q&A | Office hours + make gates pass + document “how to fix failures” | Pipeline template + gate results + short runbook note |
| 8 | Observability module build (logs/metrics/traces patterns) | Implement observability module skeleton + local validation | Instrumentation demo + troubleshooting | Office hours + complete runbook + add correlation IDs | Observability module + runbook |
| 9 | Security & compliance drills (redaction, model choice, prompt review) | Red-team prompt drill + remediation plan | Prompt redaction review + policy walkthrough | Office hours + finalize prompt policy + checklist | Prompt policy + redaction checklist + drill findings |
| 10 | Capstone ship + ROI readout (before/after) | Finalize capstone PRs + KPI delta capture | Capstone walkthrough + exec readout structure | Office hours + tighten narrative + ensure rubric compliance | Capstone PR(s) + KPI delta report + exec readout draft |

## If you need a lighter schedule (Foundations-tier adaptation)
- Keep **Monday (1h)** + **Tuesday (2h)** + **Friday (1h)**.
- Replace live session/office hours with: **1 hour self-review** + **1 hour optional community Q&A**.
- Target **~3–4 hours/week** total.
