# Ensemble AI-SDLC — 10-Week Delivery & Time-Commitment Blocking (v1)

This document is the **authoritative strawman** for the Ensemble AI-SDLC engagement.
It captures the agreed **10-week structure**, **learner time commitments**, and **instructor load assumptions** based on live discussion and whiteboard planning.

---

## Executive Summary

**Program shape:**  
- **Weeks 1–2:** Fundamentals (lecture-only)  
- **Weeks 3–6:** Lab (safe sandbox, supervised)  
- **Weeks 7–10:** Applied (real Ensemble work, coaching + metrics)

**Learner commitment target:**  
- Fundamentals: **~4 hrs/week**  
- Lab & Applied: **~6–8 hrs/week**

**Cohorts:**  
- Two cohorts (C1, C2)  
- Fundamentals may run **combined** (single larger session)  
- Labs and Applied phases split per cohort

## A) Learner Weekly Time Blocks (External / Learner-Facing)

### Weeks 1–2: Fundamentals

**Purpose:** Build shared mental models for AI-assisted and agentic SDLC  
**No labs. No coding. No environment dependencies.**

- **Mon–Thu:**  
  - 2 × 20–30 minute sessions per day  
  - (~1 hour/day total)
- **Weekly total:** **~4 hours**

This phase is intentionally light to:
- Avoid tooling approval blockers
- Establish vocabulary and system-level understanding
- Enable parallel lab environment setup behind the scenes

---

### Weeks 3–6: Lab (Supervised)

**Purpose:** Skill acquisition in a safe sandbox (no production risk)

Typical weekly structure:

- **Lecture / demo:** 1–2 hours  
- **Setup assistance:** 1 hour  
- **Hands-on lab work (“doing”):** ~3 hours  
- **Group review / Q&A:** 1 hour  

**Weekly total:** **~6–7 hours**

---

### Weeks 7–10: Applied (Coaching)

**Purpose:** Apply learned workflows to real Ensemble work

- Same time budget as Lab weeks
- Work shifts from sandbox → real repos
- Coaching, review, and metrics become primary focus

**Weekly total:** **~6–8 hours (cap at 8)**

## B) 10-Week Learner Schedule Map

| Week | Mode | Learner Activities | Expected Time |
|----:|------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Fundamentals | 2×(20–30m)/day × 4 days | ~4h |
| 2 | Fundamentals | 2×(20–30m)/day × 4 days | ~4h |
| 3 | Lab | Lecture + setup + lab + review | ~6–7h |
| 4 | Lab | Lecture + setup + lab + review | ~6–7h |
| 5 | Lab | Lecture + setup + lab + review | ~6–7h |
| 6 | Lab | Lecture + setup + lab + review | ~6–7h |
| 7 | Applied | Coaching + real project work | ~6–8h |
| 8 | Applied | Coaching + real project work | ~6–8h |
| 9 | Applied | Coaching + real project work | ~6–8h |
| 10 | Applied | Coaching + real project work + wrap-up | ~6–8h |

## C) Instructor / Coach Load (Internal Planning View)

> This section is **not learner-facing**.  
> It exists to keep delivery expectations realistic.

### Weeks 1–2: Fundamentals

- **Live delivery:**  
  - ~1 hour/day (≈ 4 hours/week)
- **Content creation:**  
  - ~5–7 hours/day while material is being built
- **Parallel work:**  
  - Lab environment creation  
  - Security / IT coordination  
  - Tooling approval workflows

Goal: labs ready by the end of Week 2.

---

### Weeks 3–10: Lab + Applied

- **Live interaction:**  
  - ~2–3 hours/day across two cohorts
- **Support & prep:**  
  - Lab/exercise creation  
  - Office hours  
  - Async support
- **Steady-state target (post-content):**  
  - Delivery-only load can drop toward **~8 hours/week**

This is the **scalability breakpoint** once content is fully captured and reused.

---

## D) Structural Constraints (Explicit)

- Enterprise security constraints are real and assumed
- Off-network coaching preferred
- Tooling approvals may lag → Fundamentals intentionally front-loaded
- Applied phase depends on labs being approved and usable by Week 7
- Time caps are intentional to avoid “shadow consulting”

---

## E) What This Document Is

- The **baseline contract** for time, scope, and expectations
- The reference for:
  - Scheduling
  - SOW language
  - Sales conversations
  - Internal capacity planning

Any deviation should be explicit and intentional.
