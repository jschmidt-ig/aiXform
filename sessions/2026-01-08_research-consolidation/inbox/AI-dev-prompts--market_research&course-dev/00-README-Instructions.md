# What to do (no copy/paste between runs)

You will do two runs. You will NOT copy/paste outputs from Run 1 into Run 2.
Instead, you will *attach a file* from Run 1 to Run 2.

## Run 1 — Research (GPT-5.2 Pro Research / Deep Research, web ON)
1) Open ChatGPT.
2) Select **GPT-5.2 Pro Research** (Deep research).
3) Turn **web/search ON** (globe icon).
4) Use one of these methods:
   - Preferred: Upload `02-PROMPT-01-Research-Full.md` as an attachment and say: “Execute the attached prompt exactly.”
   - Alternate: Open the file, copy its contents once, paste into chat, run.
5) The model will output:
   - A full research report (with citations)
   - A section labeled **ATTACHMENT: Research_Packet.md** (content for a markdown file)

6) Save/export the **ATTACHMENT: Research_Packet.md** content as a file named `Research_Packet.md`.
   - Use ChatGPT’s export/download UI if available.
   - If your UI only shows text, use “Save as…” in your browser to save the code block as a .md file.
   - Goal: end with a real file named `Research_Packet.md` on disk.

## Run 2 — Synthesis (GPT-5.2 Thinking, web OFF)
1) Start a new chat (recommended).
2) Select **GPT-5.2 Thinking**.
3) Turn **web/search OFF** (globe icon off).
4) Upload BOTH:
   - `03-PROMPT-02-Thinking-Full.md`
   - `Research_Packet.md` (the file produced by Run 1)
5) In chat, say: “Execute the attached thinking prompt exactly, using the attached Research_Packet.md as input.”
6) Output will be your final product + course design deliverables (decisions, tables, curriculum, templates, MVP vs v2 plan, GTM, SOW addendum, etc.)

## Notes
- If tool approvals slip beyond week 1, Run 2 should include a contingency plan (it is required by the prompt).
- After Run 2, you can optionally ask for a “Sales-optimized” version or “Deck outline.”
