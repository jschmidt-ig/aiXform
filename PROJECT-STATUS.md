- Templates for lessons, labs, assessments
- Marketing brochures (Fundamentals, Labs) + Foundations landing page

---

## What Needs Creation

### Curriculum
- Slide decks for 20 Fundamentals sessions
- Recorded video content for Weeks 1-2
- Detailed lab instructions with step-by-step guidance
- Starter code and production codebase examples
- Safe sandbox environments
- Assessment answer keys
- Instructor facilitation guides

### Marketing
- Case study template for pilot outcomes

### Research
- Competitive landscape analysis
- Enterprise AI adoption market research
- ROI data for training effectiveness

## Tooling

**Ensemble Pilot:** Claude (approved) - Claude Code CLI as primary agentic harness

**Future Clients (placeholder):** Some enterprises may be restricted to Windows + GitHub Copilot. Content for Copilot CLI workflows will need to be developed for those engagements.

## Enterprise Constraints

- No external SaaS uploads allowed
- PHI/PII redaction requirements
- Only approved AI models (no free-tier APIs)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Gap Analysis** - Map specs to content that must be created
2. **Week 1 Critical Path** - Minimum viable content for launch
3. **Production Schedule** - Assign content creation across team
4. **Environment Setup** - Prepare sandbox repos and lab infrastructure
5. **Dry Run** - Test delivery flow before live sessions
