## What Exists

- Business model and pricing (L1/L2/L3 tiers)
- 10-week delivery framework
- Full curriculum structure (syllabi, lab outlines, rubrics)
- Maturity model framework and visuals

- Recorded video content for Weeks 1-2
- Detailed lab instructions with step-by-step guidance
- Starter code and brownfield codebase examples

## Enterprise Constraints

- Windows + GitHub Copilot as primary client tooling
- No external SaaS uploads allowed
- PHI/PII redaction requirements
- Only approved AI models (no free-tier APIs)

## Next Steps

1. **Gap Analysis** - Map specs to content that must be created
2. **Week 1 Critical Path** - Minimum viable content for launch
3. **Production Schedule** - Assign content creation across team
4. **Environment Setup** - Prepare sandbox repos and lab infrastructure
5. **Dry Run** - Test delivery flow before live sessions
