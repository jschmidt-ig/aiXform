# AI Accelerated Software Development — Pricing & Time Commitment

## Program structure (10 weeks)

| Phase | Weeks | Format |
|---|---:|---|
| Fundamentals | 1–2 | 20 sessions (lectures + demos) |
| Labs | 3–6 | 4 hands-on labs |
| Applied | 7–10 | Team coaching on real projects |

**Total duration:** 10 weeks  
**Learner commitment:** 8–10 hours/week (80–100 hours total)

## List pricing (Praxis)

This is the forward pricing model for steady-state delivery (not the hourly pilot).

| Component | Pricing unit | List price |
|---|---|---:|
| Fundamentals (Phase 1) | per seat | $500 |
| Labs (Phase 2) | per seat | $2,500 |
| Applied (Phase 3) | per cohort | $20,000 |

### Total list price formulas

Let:
- **C** = number of cohorts (1–3 typical)
- **N** = seats per cohort (up to 20)

Then:
- **Per-seat total for Phases 1–2:** $3,000 per seat
- **Applied total:** $20,000 × C
- **Program total:** C × ( $3,000 × N + $20,000 )

**Examples**
- 1 cohort × 15 seats: $65,000
- 1 cohort × 20 seats: $80,000
- 3 cohorts × 15 seats: $195,000
- 3 cohorts × 20 seats: $240,000

## Pilot billing model (hourly)

For the first run with Ensemble, Praxis can deliver under the already-approved **hourly contract** to minimize procurement friction.

**Estimated instructor effort (first pilot):** ~150–210 hours total
- Weeks 1–2: 25–35 hrs/week
- Weeks 3–6: 15–20 hrs/week
- Weeks 7–10: 10–15 hrs/week

**Estimated cost under hourly contract:** `hourly_rate × (150–210)`

## Trainer effort (planning reference)

Once content is captured and reusable, steady-state delivery load typically drops.

| Phase | Steady-state weekly hours | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Fundamentals (Weeks 1–2) | ~4 hrs/week | Live delivery only |
| Labs (Weeks 3–6) | ~8–10 hrs/week | Live interaction + support |
| Applied (Weeks 7–10) | ~8 hrs/week | Coaching sessions + office hours |

---

## Notes

- Applied pricing assumes **team-level coaching** and an **executive readout**.
- If Ensemble chooses to scale beyond the pilot, Praxis can propose a rollout structure (self-paced + cohort + coached).
