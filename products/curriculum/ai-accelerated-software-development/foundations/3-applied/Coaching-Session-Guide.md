# Coaching Session Guide

A facilitation guide for Applied phase team coaching sessions (Weeks 7-10).

---

## Facilitation Philosophy

### Coach as Facilitator
Your role is to **facilitate discovery**, not prescribe solutions:
- Ask questions more than give answers
- Help teams find what works for THEM
- Create space for experimentation and learning
- Share patterns (anonymized) from other teams
- Let teams own their decisions

### Key Principles
1. **Teams know their context best** — You bring AI expertise; they bring domain expertise
2. **Safe to fail** — Encourage experimentation; celebrate learning from mistakes
3. **Sustainable practices** — Focus on what they'll continue after the pilot
4. **Practical over theoretical** — Ground discussions in real work

---

## Session Structure Template

Each 2-hour team session follows this general structure:

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| 0:00-0:10 | Check-in | How's everyone doing? Quick wins/frustrations? |
| 0:10-0:30 | Review | What happened since last session? |
| 0:30-1:15 | Main Topic | Week-specific focus area |
| 1:15-1:45 | Working Time | Hands-on activity or discussion |
| 1:45-1:55 | Action Items | What will we do before next session? |
| 1:55-2:00 | Close | Any questions? Parking lot items? |

## Week 7: Transition & Baseline

### Session Goals
- Set expectations for Applied phase
- Identify where AI fits in current work
- Capture baseline metrics
- Begin playbook discussion

### Agenda

**Check-in (10 min)**
- How are you feeling coming out of Labs?
- What are you excited to try on real work?
- Any concerns about applying this to your projects?

**Applied Phase Overview (15 min)**
- Walk through the 4-week structure
- Explain deliverables: Playbook, Capstone PRs, ROI metrics
- Clarify coaching model: team sessions, 1:1s, office hours
- Q&A

**Identifying Focus Areas (30 min)**

*Facilitation prompt:*
> "You're already working on real projects. Let's identify 1-2 areas of your current work where AI assistance could have the most impact over the next 4 weeks."

Discussion questions:
- What's on your current plate that would benefit from AI assistance?
- What tasks have you been avoiding because they're tedious?
- Where would better tests or docs have high impact?
- What's a good low-risk area to start applying what you learned in Labs?

*Good focus areas:*
- Adding test coverage to an under-tested module
- Generating/updating documentation
- Refactoring well-understood but messy code
- Tackling a backlog of minor bugs or tech debt

**Baseline Metrics (20 min)**
- Walk through ROI metrics template
- Identify what data is available
- Assign metric capture owners
- Set deadline for baseline capture

**Playbook Discussion: "How We Work Today" (30 min)**

*Facilitation prompt:*
> "Before we add AI to your workflow, let's understand your current workflow. How do you work today?"

Discussion questions:
- Walk me through a typical PR from start to merge
- How do you decide what to work on?
- How does code review work?
- What's painful or slow in your current process?
- What documentation do you maintain?

**Action Items & Close (15 min)**
- Confirm focus projects
- Assign baseline metric capture
- Schedule 1:1s if needed
- Questions and parking lot

### Facilitator Notes
- Don't rush project selection; this sets up the whole pilot
- If team struggles to identify projects, explore their backlog together
- Baseline metrics don't need to be perfect; directional is fine
- Note current workflow pain points — these are AI opportunities

---

## Week 8: Workflow Design

### Session Goals
- Review first AI-assisted work
- Learn from what worked and didn't
- Draft initial playbook sections

### Agenda

**Check-in (10 min)**
- How did the first week of AI-assisted work go?
- Any quick wins to celebrate?
- Any frustrations to discuss?

**Review: First Attempts (30 min)**

*Facilitation prompt:*
> "Let's look at what you tried this week. Show us an example of AI-assisted work — what worked, what didn't?"

For each example discussed:
- What was the task?
- How did you use AI?
- What was the output quality?
- What did you have to fix or adjust?
- What would you do differently?

**Playbook Drafting (45 min)**

Work through these playbook sections together:

*Section: When to Use AI*
> "Based on your experience this week, when does AI work well? When should you be cautious?"

*Section: Data & Security*
> "What data is okay to include in prompts? What's off-limits? How do you redact when needed?"

*Section: Code Review*
> "How should we review AI-generated code? What do you look for? What's different from human-written code?"

**Working Time: Continue Drafting (20 min)**
- Small groups work on specific playbook sections
- Coach circulates to answer questions

**Action Items & Close (15 min)**
- Playbook draft due date
- PR targets for next week
- 1:1 scheduling

### Facilitator Notes
- Encourage showing real examples, even "failed" ones
- When teams struggle to articulate rules, ask "What would you tell a new team member?"
- Playbook doesn't need to be perfect; it will iterate
- Note patterns across teams for future cohorts

---

## Week 9: Iteration & Refinement

### Session Goals
- Mid-point check on progress
- Refine playbook based on experience
- Address specific challenges
- Prepare for capstone

### Agenda

**Check-in (10 min)**

- Biggest learning so far?
- What's still confusing?

**Mid-Point Metrics Review (20 min)**
- Where are we vs baseline?
- What trends do we see?
- Any surprises?

**Playbook Retrospective (30 min)**

*Facilitation prompt:*
> "You've been living with playbook v1 for a week. What's working? What needs to change?"

Review each section:
- "When to Use AI" — still accurate?
- "Data & Security" — any gaps?
- "Code Review" — what have you learned?
- "Quality Gates" — too strict? Too loose?

**Deep Dive: Team's Choice (30 min)**
Let team choose a topic to go deeper on:
- Complex refactoring strategies
- Test generation best practices
- Documentation workflows
- Code review efficiency
- Handling AI mistakes
- [Other based on team needs]

## Office Hours Guidelines

### Purpose
Unstructured time for:
- Quick questions
- Pair working on specific problems
- Ad-hoc troubleshooting
- Catching up on missed sessions

### Format
- 2 hours/week, open drop-in
- Virtual or in-person depending on setup
- Come with specific questions or problems
- First-come, first-served (unless scheduled)

### Common Office Hours Topics
- "I'm stuck on this prompt/task"
- "Is this a good use case for AI?"
- "Can you look at this AI output with me?"
- "How do I handle [specific situation]?"
- "Help me fill out this playbook section"

---

## 1:1 Coaching Guidelines

### When to Offer 1:1s
- Team member has specific challenges
- Sensitive topic not suited for group
- Different role needs (tech lead vs IC)
- Someone falling behind
- Someone racing ahead and needs more challenge

### 1:1 Structure (30-60 min)
1. **What's on your mind?** (10 min)
2. **Dig into specifics** (30-40 min)
3. **Action items** (5-10 min)

### Common 1:1 Topics
- Individual productivity concerns
- Role-specific questions (reviewing others' AI code, leading adoption)
- Skepticism or concerns about AI
- Advanced techniques for quick learners
- Career implications questions

---

## Handling Common Situations

### Team is skeptical
- Acknowledge concerns; don't dismiss
- Focus on specific, low-risk experiments
- Let results speak
- Don't force enthusiasm

### Team is over-enthusiastic
- Channel energy into good practices
- Emphasize review and quality
- Remind them of security/data rules
- "Trust but verify"

### One person dominates discussion
- Direct questions to others
- "I'd like to hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet"
- Consider 1:1 with the dominator

### Team is too busy for the pilot
- Acknowledge the reality
- Negotiate minimum viable participation
- Focus on highest-value activities
- Consider adjusting scope

### AI output quality disappoints
- Normalize this; it happens
- Diagnose: prompt issue? wrong use case? expectations?
- Iterate together
- Share what does work

### Team wants to use unapproved tools
- Understand the need behind the request
- Explain the constraints
- Escalate if there's a legitimate case for approval
- Don't bend the rules
