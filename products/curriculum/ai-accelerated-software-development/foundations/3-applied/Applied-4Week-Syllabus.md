# Applied Coaching — Syllabus (Weeks 7-10)

Guided coaching where teams apply AI-accelerated development techniques to their actual work projects and establish sustainable team practices.

## Overview

- **Duration:** 4 weeks (Weeks 7-10 of Foundations program)
- **Format:** Team coaching + 1:1 sessions + office hours
- **Teams:** 2-3 teams per cohort
- **Time commitment:** 8-10 hours/week
- **Prerequisites:** Completion of Fundamentals (Weeks 1-2) and Labs (Weeks 3-6)

---

## Objectives

The Applied phase has three primary objectives:

### 1. Apply Tools to Real Projects
Take the skills learned in Labs and apply them to actual production codebases. Move from sandbox exercises to real deliverables with real stakes.

### 2. Customize AI Workflows for Your Context
Every team and codebase is different. Adapt the general techniques to your specific:
- Technology stack
- Team structure
- Security requirements
- Existing workflows

### 3. Establish New Ways of Working
Define team practices and governance for AI-assisted development:
- Team AI Playbook/Charter
- Code review practices with AI-generated code
- Quality gates and approval workflows
- Metrics and continuous improvement

## Key Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description | Due |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| **Team AI Playbook** | Team's rules, practices, and workflows for AI-assisted development | Week 10 |
| **Capstone PRs** | Real PRs demonstrating AI-assisted workflow on production code | Week 10 |
| **ROI Metrics** | Before/after measurements for leadership readout | Week 10 |
| **Executive Readout** | Summary presentation of outcomes and recommendations | Week 10 |

---

## Coaching Structure

### Weekly Team Sessions (2 hours/week)
Structured facilitated sessions with the whole team:
- Week 7: Transition from Labs + identify focus areas + baseline metrics
- Week 8: Workflow design + playbook drafting
- Week 9: Mid-point review + iteration
- Week 10: Capstone review + executive readout prep

### 1:1 Coaching (as needed)
Individual sessions for:
- Specific technical challenges
- Role-specific questions (tech lead vs IC)
- Sensitive topics not suited for group

### Office Hours (2 hours/week)
Open drop-in time for:
- Quick questions
- Pair working on specific problems
- Ad-hoc troubleshooting

---

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 7: Transition & Baseline

**Goal:** Transition from Labs to real work; establish baseline metrics

**Team Session Topics:**
- Applied phase overview and expectations
- Identify where AI fits in your current work
- Baseline metrics capture (current state)
- Initial playbook discussion: "How do we work today?"

**Activities:**
- [ ] Identify 1-2 areas of current work to focus AI efforts
- [ ] Capture baseline metrics (PR velocity, test coverage, etc.)
- [ ] Document current workflows
- [ ] Identify first AI-assisted tasks to attempt

**Outputs:**
- Focus areas identified
- Baseline metrics captured
- Week 8 plan agreed

---

### Week 8: Workflow Design

**Goal:** Design and document team AI practices

**Team Session Topics:**
- Review first AI-assisted work attempts
- What worked? What didn't?
- Draft team AI playbook sections:
  - When to use AI (and when not to)
  - Code review practices for AI-generated code
  - Security and data handling rules
  - Quality gates and approval workflows

**Activities:**
- [ ] Complete at least 2 AI-assisted PRs per team member
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Draft playbook v1
- [ ] Identify workflow improvements

**Outputs:**
- Draft Team AI Playbook
- Initial PR examples
- Identified improvements for Week 9

---

### Week 9: Iteration & Refinement

**Goal:** Refine practices based on real experience

**Team Session Topics:**
- Mid-point metrics review
- Playbook v1 retrospective
- Deeper topics based on team needs:
  - Complex refactoring with AI
  - Test generation strategies
  - Documentation workflows
  - Code review efficiency

**Activities:**
- [ ] Continue AI-assisted work on focus projects
- [ ] Iterate on playbook based on experience
- [ ] Prepare capstone PR candidates
- [ ] Begin ROI data collection

**Outputs:**
- Playbook v2 (refined)
- Capstone PR candidates identified
- Mid-point metrics

---

### Week 10: Capstone & Readout

**Goal:** Finalize deliverables and communicate results

**Team Session Topics:**
- Capstone PR reviews
- Final playbook review and sign-off
- ROI metrics compilation
- Executive readout preparation
- Sustainability planning: "What happens after the pilot?"

**Activities:**
- [ ] Finalize capstone PRs
- [ ] Complete Team AI Playbook
- [ ] Compile ROI metrics
- [ ] Prepare executive readout
- [ ] Plan for ongoing adoption

**Outputs:**
- Final Team AI Playbook
- Capstone PRs merged (or ready to merge)
- ROI metrics report
- Executive readout deck
- Sustainability recommendations

---

## Facilitation Approach

### Coach as Facilitator
The coach's role is to **facilitate**, not prescribe:
- Help teams discover what works for them
- Ask questions more than give answers
- Share patterns from other teams (anonymized)
- Create space for experimentation

### Team Ownership
Teams own their:
- Playbook content and rules
- Workflow decisions
- Success metrics
- Adoption pace

### Safe Experimentation
- Encourage trying new approaches
- Celebrate learning from failures
- No judgment on "wrong" approaches
- Focus on continuous improvement

---

## Focus Area Criteria

Good focus areas for Applied phase:

**Ideal characteristics:**
- Real production code (not sandbox)
- Meaningful but bounded scope
- Team has authority to merge changes
- Low risk if something goes wrong
- Visible impact when successful

**Examples:**
- Add test coverage to an under-tested module
- Refactor a well-understood but messy component
- Generate/update documentation for a service
- Implement a small, well-defined feature
- Fix a backlog of minor bugs

**Avoid:**
- Critical path production changes
- Security-sensitive code without proper review
- Large architectural changes
- Anything requiring extensive approvals

---

## Metrics & ROI

### Baseline Metrics (Week 7)
Capture before starting AI-assisted work:
- PR cycle time (open to merge)
- PR size (lines changed)
- Test coverage %
- Documentation completeness
- Time spent on specific task types

### Progress Metrics (Weeks 8-9)
Track during Applied phase:
- AI-assisted PRs completed
- Time savings (self-reported)
- Quality observations
- Workflow friction points

### Final Metrics (Week 10)
Compare to baseline:
- PR velocity change
- Test coverage delta
- Documentation improvements
- Team satisfaction/confidence
- Qualitative improvements
