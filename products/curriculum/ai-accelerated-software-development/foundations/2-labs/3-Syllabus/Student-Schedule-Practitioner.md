## Assumptions
- Practitioner tier (Guided Cohort Enablement)
- Expected time: ~6 hours/week (target range 5–7)
- Same weekly blocks to create routine

## Weekly cadence (repeat every week)

| Day | Time (example) | Activity | Time |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| Monday | 6:00–7:00pm | Watch the week’s lecture(s) + take notes | 1h |
| Tuesday | 6:00–8:00pm | Lab block #1 (hands-on) | 2h |
| Wednesday | 12:00–1:00pm | Live cohort session (demo + Q&A) | 1h |
| Thursday | 6:00–8:00pm | Office hours (1h) + Lab block #2 (1h) | 2h |
| Friday | 4:00–5:00pm | Submit artifact(s) + self-review + plan next week | 1h |

**Total:** ~6 hours/week

Optional catch-up:
- Sunday 30–60 minutes for backlog cleanup or “brownfield read-only analysis”
