# Lab 05 (Optional) — UI + Browser-Based E2E Testing & Automation

## Why this lab exists (optional)
Some enterprise teams need full-stack workflows and regression automation. This lab adds:
- a minimal UI (frontend) for the API
- browser-based E2E tests (Playwright or Cypress)
- CI integration for E2E smoke tests

## Scenario
Build a minimal UI for the Pet Registry API:
- list pets
- add a pet
- view details
Then create E2E tests to prove it works.

## Deliverables
1) UI (minimal, functional)
2) E2E test suite (minimum 3 tests)
3) CI job that runs E2E tests (optional if CI constraints)
4) Short E2E runbook and failure triage notes

## Timebox
- 4–6 hours (optional week, or as capstone extension)

## Notes
This lab is intentionally left “designable” via the research prompts in `5-Prompts/` so you can:
- pick tech (React/Vue/Blazor/etc.)
- pick testing stack (Playwright/Cypress)
- align to client standards
