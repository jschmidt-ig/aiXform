# AI Coordination

How Claude and GT coordinate work on the aiXform project.

---

## The Setup

| Name | Model | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| **Claude** | Claude Code CLI | Lead AI — coordinates project, assigns work |
| **GT** | GPT 5.2 | Helper — takes on assigned tasks |

**Either AI can work on anything.** This file exists to prevent simultaneous edits and keep everyone in sync.

## How to Use This

### Starting Work
1. Check if anyone else is working on related files
2. Add a row with your task and 🔄 In Progress
3. Do your work
4. Update your row to ✅ Done with notes

### Handoff Notes
When you finish, leave notes for the other AI:
- What you created/changed
- Decisions you made
- Questions or blockers
- Suggested next steps

### Conflicts
If you find conflicting changes:
1. Don't overwrite — preserve both versions
2. Note the conflict here
3. Let Justin decide

## Current Gaps (Assign as Needed)

These need to be done. Claude assigns or Justin directs.

- Recorded video content for Weeks 1-2
- Detailed lab instructions with step-by-step guidance
- Starter code and production codebase examples
- Safe sandbox environments
- Assessment answer keys

### Marketing

### Research

## File Naming Conventions

Both AIs should follow these:

- **Markdown:** `Title-With-Dashes.md`
- **HTML:** `descriptive-name.html` (lowercase)
- **Sessions:** `YYYY-MM-DD_short-description/`
- **Research:** `YYYY-MM-DD_topic-name.md` (dated for freshness)
